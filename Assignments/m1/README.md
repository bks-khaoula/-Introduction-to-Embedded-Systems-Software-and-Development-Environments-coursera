This repo contains the assessments files:
Write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, we need to reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, we need to print that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation. We need to submit a version controlled repository of these 3 files:

     stats.c - Implementation file for your C-programming code

     stats.h -  Header file for your C-programming code

     README.md -  Includes information on the author and the project
